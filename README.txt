Hi! My name is Victor and this is my systems assignment.

I learned a lot during this project. I had never programmed in Go before, and actually attempted to do this project in C++
before feeling compelled to attempt it in a new language instead. I have no regrets, because Go is an awesome langauge that I
now feel comfortable with. I also learned react and some javascript for this project, not languages I feel all that comfortable with
but I hope my work shows that I am willing and able to learn.

The most difficult part of this assignment was the initial hurdle of understanding how to fetch and query information on the front end in react
while also inputting that information into the kv_namespace in a meaningful way.

I attempted a good amount of extra credit. I added user posts, content variety, comments, and a voting system that sorts the posts by their 
upvotes/downvotes. These were all fun problems to solve and I learned a lot through doing so.

Thank you for the opportunity to grow as a developer! I had a blast making this, and hope it shows.
